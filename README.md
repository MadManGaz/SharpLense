# SharpLense
This is a very utilitarian tool I made to take a closer look at GameBoy ROMs. It just presents all the opcodes of GameBoy machine code into more intelligible ASM-like stuff.

## Plans
It all needs a serious refactor to turn it into a library and it was a mistake to hard code printing to the console in the giant switch. I know exactly how to make this better, so I'll be doing that (might get around to this before the end of 2019). Also need to write some unit tests, because it may well be this doesn't actually work.
